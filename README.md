### Task (extract):

- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs. Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file!
- Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would. 
- Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.

Added features:
- Toggle borders between squares
- Drop-down menu to chose between colors

### Task (extract):

- Your calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators[...]. add, subtract, multiply & divide
- Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key. 
- Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. **For example, $12 + 7 - 5 * 3 =$ should yield $42$.**
- Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. 

Added features:
- Maximum length for numbers are 9 digits (including '.')
